# IDT-BrainFuck Interpreter
### Speedy BrainFuck Interpreter with a fair ammount of features (for a brainfuck interpreter anyway)
#### The size switch is still disfunctional, may be removed in future versions

Useage:

    Type 'bf' alone in the terminal to run interactive interpreter
    
    Type 'bf <file path>.bf' to run a brainfuck script

    Add switches to tell the interpreter what you want to do.
    
    `-i`, `-o`, and `-s` can be used in combination, `-a` & `-h` are to be used on their own.
    
Switches:
    
    -i : bf <file name>.bf -i <input file>
    
    -o : bf <file name>.bf -o <output file>
    
    -s : bf <file name>.bf -s <array size> (currently broken)
    
    -a : start the interpreter in auto eval REPL mode
    
    -h : bf -h (prints this message)
